      <p>Even though I can't be with you today I want you to know that I love you and thank you for everything you've done for me through the years.</p>
      <p>All the encouragment I never knew I needed. All the wisdom I didn't think I needed. And all the love that I could ever have needed.</p>
      <p>It's because of the wonderful mother that you are I am able to be the man I am today.</p>
      <h2>I love you <em>very</em> much.</h2>
